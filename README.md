## 18F Content Guild

Welcome to the 18F Content Guild repository! We welcome you to explore, make suggestions, and contribute to our projects.

For context: an [18F Guild](https://pages.18f.gov/grouplet-playbook/guilds/) is a group of 18F team members with a particular mission. Ours is to integrate content strategy into all 18F projects, and to promote painless, concise, and elegant writing.

This repository includes [a bit of metadata](https://github.com/18F/g-content/blob/18f-pages/.about.yml) about our guild in a standard format that other 18F projects can interpret (see the [.about.yml project](https://github.com/18F/about_yml)).
